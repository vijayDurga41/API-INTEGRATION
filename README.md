Project Description: Responsive Weather Application

This project is a dynamic and responsive web application designed to fetch and display current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides users with two primary methods to get weather data:

City-Based Search: Users can input a specific city name into a search bar, and the application will retrieve and display the weather conditions for that city.
Geolocation-Based Weather: Leveraging the browser's Geolocation API, the application can automatically detect the user's current location (with their permission) and display the weather forecast for their precise coordinates.
Key Features:

Dynamic Data Loading: Weather data is fetched asynchronously from a public API, ensuring the information displayed is always up-to-date.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface allows for easy city input and clear presentation of weather details.
Comprehensive Weather Details: Displays essential weather information including:
City and Country Name
Current Temperature
"Feels Like" Temperature
Weather Description (e.g., "clear sky," "cloudy")
Humidity Percentage
Wind Speed
Responsive Design: Built with modern CSS techniques (Flexbox and Media Queries), the webpage adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid city names, network issues, or denied geolocation permissions, providing informative feedback to the user.
Technologies Used:

HTML5: For structuring the content and layout of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript (ES6+): For handling user interactions, fetching data from the API, parsing JSON responses, and dynamically updating the Document Object Model (DOM).
OpenWeatherMap API: A third-party public API used as the data source for weather information.
Browser Geolocation API: Utilized to obtain the user's latitude and longitude for location-based weather forecasts.
This project serves as a practical demonstration of integrating external APIs, handling asynchronous operations, and implementing responsive web design principles to create a functional and engaging user experience.
